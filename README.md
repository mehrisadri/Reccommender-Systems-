Data is important to us. However, we can do more with qualatative data than most think.

SCRAG will be building an in-house reccommender system which uplifts restaurants in the Mira Mesa & Scripps Ranch communities. Using YelpAPI, we will be incorporating dynamic questions 
to propose an appropriate restaurant based on user inputs. We hope to improve this model over time to give larger emphasis to non-chain eateries, as well as incorporate infrastructure that 
improves overall accuracy over time!
Furthermore, we will be taking the anonymous data entries over a period of time to view how consumer preferences change amid economic, social, or seasonal changes throughout time. We believe that
such insights will be beneficial to small business owners or Chambers of Commerce

We are looking forward to publishing our v1 on srcag.net!
